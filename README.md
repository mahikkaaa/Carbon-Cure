## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze and predict carbon emissions from electricity generation using machine learning techniques. The project leverages a comprehensive dataset to gain insights into the factors influencing carbon emissions and develop a predictive model to forecast future emissions.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on carbon emissions from electricity generation, including key features such as energy source code, year and month, carbon emission values, and metadata columns (column order, description, and unit of measurement). The target variable for prediction is the "Value" column.

- **MSN:** Energy source code
- **YYYYMM:** Year and month
- **Value:** Carbon emissions
- **Column_Order:** Order of the column
- **Description:** Description of the column
- **Unit:** Unit of measurement

## Objectives

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Perform a detailed exploration of the dataset, understanding its structure, summary statistics, and carbon emission distribution.
- Visualize temporal trends to identify patterns and seasonality.
- Explore correlations between carbon emissions and relevant features such as electricity generation sources and environmental factors.

### Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing data and outliers.
- Convert data types and ensure the dataset is suitable for machine learning.
- Perform feature engineering, extracting additional information from date columns if necessary.

### Machine Learning Modeling

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression tasks.
- Train the model using historical data, with a focus on predicting carbon emissions.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared.

### Feature Importance Analysis

- Identify the most influential features contributing to carbon emissions.
- Visualize and interpret feature importance scores obtained from the machine learning model.
